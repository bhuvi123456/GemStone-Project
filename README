### created an virtual evironment(my env)
~~~
python -m venv myenv

###
install all necessary libraries written in requirments.txt

### #Requirments.txt file  is used to save and to install all necessary libraries
~~~
-e .    #whenever we give new libraries it should install the new libraries so using this for setup.py gets trigger and install
        #But '-e.' is cannot installable right so we will write few lines in setup.py 
        #if we does not mention '-e .' in requirments then we will not able to get file of setup.py because there will be no connection blw setup.py and requirments.txt 
~~~
### we need to have setup.py file to activate the whole project as package or initializing the packages for which folder we need to have
~~~
we will have __init__.py wherever we need to activate packages for individual folder for only the folders we need to make as package
